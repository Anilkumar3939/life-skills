# Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH)

## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Unwelcome physical contact or advances.
- Inappropriate or sexually suggestive remarks, jokes, or gestures.
- Sharing obscene or offensive materials (texts, images, emails).
- Making sexually colored remarks.
- Staring, leering, or making others uncomfortable with oneâ€™s behavior.
- Any behavior that creates a hostile, offensive, or intimidating work environment.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I face or witness sexual harassment, I would:

1. **Ensure safety** of the affected person and remain composed.
2. **Note down key details** like the date, time, location, people involved, and any witnesses.
3. **Report the matter** promptly to the Internal Committee (IC) or POSH team in the organization.
4. If unsure, **consult HR or a trusted authority** for guidance on next steps.
5. **Support the victim**, ensure they feel heard, and maintain confidentiality.
6. Avoid direct confrontation with the accused unless absolutely necessary and safe.
