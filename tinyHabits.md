# Tiny Habits

## Question 1: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

One of the most interesting ideas in this video was how tiny changes can lead to remarkable results over time. BJ Fogg explains that instead of forcing big changes that require willpower, we should focus on making habits so small that they are almost impossible to fail. This makes it easier to start and maintain new behaviors, creating a ripple effect that gradually transforms our lives without overwhelming us.

## Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make forming new habits easier? What do M, A, and P stand for?

The formula B = MAP means that Behavior (B) happens when Motivation (M), Ability (A), and a Prompt (P) come together at the same time.

- **Motivation (M):** The desire or willingness to perform the behavior.
- **Ability (A):** How easy or simple the behavior is to do.
- **Prompt (P):** The trigger that reminds or cues you to perform the behavior.

For example, I plan to post on LinkedIn every time I learn something new, even if it’s a small detail. This habit works because:

- Motivation: I feel motivated when I receive positive feedback from my network.
- Ability: Posting small updates is easy and doesn’t take much time.
- Prompt: The act of learning something new acts as a reminder to share it.

This combination helps me stay consistent and encourages continuous learning and sharing.

## Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

Celebrating each small success creates positive emotions that reinforce the behavior, making it more likely to become a lasting habit. When we acknowledge and enjoy our achievements—even tiny ones—our brain links the habit to a feeling of reward and satisfaction. This makes us naturally want to repeat the behavior.

For example, when I celebrate learning something new by sharing it on LinkedIn and receiving positive responses, I feel motivated to continue. This joy and recognition act as fuel, turning the act of learning and sharing into a habit that can bring meaningful change over time.

## Question 4: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most compelling idea in this video was the concept of making small, consistent improvements each day. James Clear emphasizes that achieving remarkable results doesn't require drastic changes; instead, it's about making tiny adjustments that compound over time. This approach makes the process of improvement more manageable and sustainable, leading to significant growth in the long run.

## Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?

In *Atomic Habits*, James Clear emphasizes that **identity** is the core of lasting behavior change. Instead of focusing solely on outcomes (e.g., "I want to lose weight") or processes (e.g., "I will exercise regularly"), Clear suggests we should aim to change our identity. For instance, adopting the identity of "I am a healthy eater" or "I am a runner" aligns our habits with the type of person we want to become. This identity-based approach makes habits more sustainable because our actions reflect our beliefs about ourselves.

## Question 6: How to make a habit easier to do?

Clear proposes several strategies to make habits easier:

- **Reduce friction:** Simplify the steps required to perform the habit. For example, lay out your workout clothes the night before to make exercising more convenient.
- **Design your environment:** Place cues for your desired habits in visible locations. For example, keep a book on your pillow to remind you to read before bed.
- **Use the two-minute rule:** Start with a habit that takes just two minutes, like meditating for one minute.
- **Automate habits:** Set up systems like scheduled workout sessions or reminders to make the habit automatic.

By applying these strategies, the effort needed to perform the habit decreases, increasing consistency.

## Question 7: How to make a habit harder to do?

To break a bad habit, Clear suggests increasing the friction associated with it:

- **Remove cues:** Out of sight, out of mind. Remove triggers like uninstalling distracting apps.
- **Add steps:** Make the habit less convenient. Store unhealthy snacks in hard-to-reach places.
- **Use commitment devices:** Add accountability by telling others about your goals.

Making bad habits more difficult reduces their occurrence and helps replace them with better ones.

## Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What steps can you take to make the cue obvious, the habit more attractive or easy, and the response satisfying?

I plan to actively share my skills and achievements on LinkedIn as a way to celebrate my growth. To support this habit, I will place a LinkedIn shortcut on my desktop for easy access. Additionally, I will engage in conversations with professionals on LinkedIn, whose messages will serve as reminders and motivation to use the platform regularly.

## Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What steps can you take to make the cue invisible, the process unattractive or hard, or the response unsatisfying?

I want to reduce the time I spend on Instagram. To do this, I will enable two-factor authentication for added security and log out after each session. These steps will create extra effort to access the app, making it less convenient and helping me cut down on usage.
